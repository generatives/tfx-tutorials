# TFX Tutorials

These are the completed tutorials from the [TFX documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/tfx/penguin_simple), altered slightly to run on Windows. You will need to enabled long path names as well for this to run on Windows. I have added a "FullPipeline" folder which brings all the different features from the different tutorials together.
